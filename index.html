				<h2 id="vc">Use in-game proximity voice chat:</h2>
				<p>
					We use the same <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat">in-game proximity voice chat</a> that the Hermitcraft SMP uses. You need to install this mod with the <b>correct version</b> in order to use the voice chat with others. If you don't know how to install mods or which version to use, refer to <a href="https://survival-pi.com/#modpack">the modpack section</a> above. The Survival-Pi modpack already includes the voice chat mod including many more mods to boost your performance and experience.
				</p>
				Below are a couple of key bindings that will help you with using the mod. You can change the key bindings in your controls settings.
				<ul>
					<li><b>v</b>: Open voice chat settings to adjust your microphone or set it to push-to-talk or otherwise.</li>
					<li><b>g</b>: Open the group window for creating and joining group calls. When using groups you can hear your friend anywhere.</li>
					<li><b>m</b>: Mute your microphone (When push-to-talk is deactivated).</li>
					<li><b>n</b>: Disable voice chat. You can hear nobody and nobody can hear you.</li>
					<li><b>h</b>: Toggle between hiding and showing the icon on the bottom left.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="get-money">How to get money:</h2>
				You don't need your own shop to get money. You can exchange your diamonds for money. Read the tutorial below on how to do that.
				<ol>
					<li>Go to spawn (<code>/spawn</code>) and find the market booths with two chest shops inside it that sell diamonds.</li>
					<li>Left-click the sign in front of the chest that says "Buying".</li>
					<li>Type into the chat the amount you want to sell. Enter integers only. For example "1", "10" or "64". Type "all" to sell all diamonds in your inventory. Then press ENTER.</li>
					<li>Use the command <code>/bal</code> to view your bank account balance. Use the command <code>/baltop</code> to view other player's bank accounts. For every diamond you get $50.</li>
					<li>Use the other diamond shop that says "Selling" to exchange money back to diamonds. For every $50 you get one diamond. You use that shop the same way as described above.</li>
